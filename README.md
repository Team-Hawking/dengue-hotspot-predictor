In the recent years the world has witnessed a dramatic surge of a mosquito-borne viral disease commonly known as - Dengue. According to the World Health Organization (WHO) an estimated 500,000 people are hospitalized each year due to this disease. Today, 40% of the world population is at risk of being affected by Dengue. The prime carrier of this disease are the female mosquito of the "Aedes aegypti" species. But not all corners of the world are equally likely to be affected by Dengue nor is everyone at similar level of risk. Using NASA satellite data points coupled with data points on soil, water, temperature, air quality and density of population of a particular area, applying machine learning models, we present a predictive analytics tool which will predict the next hotspot of Dengue and help us save lives of millions of people, by taking preventive action or supplying adequate medical resources before it's too late.   

## Metrices

Metrics are the factors which can help us generate a predictive value for the breeding spot of Aedes mosquito and the outbreak of Dengue as whole. The key metrices we are considering: *Temperature*, *Precipitation*, *Humidity*, *Vegetation*.
