# Dengue Hotspot Predictor

In the recent years the world has witnessed a dramatic surge of a mosquito-borne viral disease commonly known as - Dengue. According to the World Health Organization (WHO) an estimated 500,000 people are hospitalized each year due to this disease. Today, 40% of the world population is at risk of being affected by Dengue. The prime carrier of this disease are the female mosquito of the "Aedes aegypti" species. But not all corners of the world are equally likely to be affected by Dengue nor is everyone at similar level of risk. Using NASA satellite data points coupled with NASA datasets on soil, water, temperature, air quality and density of population of a particular area, applying machine learning models, we present a predictive analytics tool which will predict the next hotspot of Dengue and help us save lives of millions of people, by taking preventive action or supplying adequate medical resources before it's too late.

## Metrics

Metrics are the factors which can help us generate a predictive value for the breeding spot of Aedes mosquito and the outbreak of Dengue as whole. The key metrices we are considering:  *Temperature*, *Precipitation*, *Relative Humidity*, *Vegetation*, *Railfall*

### Temperature

 - Most common throughout tropical and sub-tropical region

 - Optimal temperatures for development, longevity, and fecundity are between 22°C and 32°C ([Beserra et al. 2009](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jvec.12187#jvec12187-bib-0004))
 
 - Temperature 10°C and below limits the growth of larvae and adult survival

 - Higher temperature are favourable for growth of Aedes
 
 - Projected temperature elevation of 2°C by the end of the 21st century (cross check sources) [(Donalísio and Glasser 2002)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jvec.12187#jvec12187-bib-0015)


- In Taiwan, [study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5759216/) shows a 13.8°C is a critical temperature to limit the occurance of *Aedes*
